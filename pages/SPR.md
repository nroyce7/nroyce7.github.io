# Surface Plasmon Resonance
For my Introduction to Research Methods course we were split up into groups and given a semester long experiment to work on. My group's project had to do with Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).

### What is Surface Plasmon Resonance
SPR is the resonant oscillation of conduction electrons at the interface between negative and positive permittivity material stimulated by incident light.

A glass slide was covered in gold using a sputter coater, which atomizes gold using plasma. We needed a 40nm layer for optimal SPR and decided to use the Atomic Force Microscope to try to measure the gold slides we were making. It took a lot of trial and error as well as the help of the Intrumentation Innovator, but we managed to get this image that measures the gold ridge on the glass slide.
