## Data Transmission With Optical Vortices

This project was my first undertaking in the Optics lab at Stout as well as my first foray into scientific work in general. 

### What's an Optical Vortex?
An optical vortex is a phenomenon that occurs when a beam of light is given Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM), in other words the beam “twists” itself around its axis of propagation. This causes the beam’s intensity at the very center to drop to zero creating what would look like a “tube” of light. There are several new measurable properties the beam gains, such as topological charge which describes how many times the beam twists in one wavelength. Methods to create optical vortices include using computer generated holograms, deformable mirrors, as well as a spatial light modulator (SLM). We opted to use the SLM.
