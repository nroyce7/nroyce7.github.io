# Projects

These are some of the projects I am working on or have completed!

## Optical Vortices

I worked on a proof of concept system that uses the optical phenomenon known as an Optical Vortex created with a spatial light modulator, paired with programmable Arduino Boards to encode and decode the beam in order to transmit data through air. <br />

## Surface Plasmon Resonance
Shining light at the interface of a dielectric and a conductor gives us a strange byproduct known as a plasmon; a discrete packet of plasma that acts like a particle. We studied this phenomena in my Intro to Research Methods class. <br />

## Fiber Characterization
For my final project in my Nanomaterials course I looked at various fibers under a Scanning Electron Microscope in order to characterize them.

## Simulations
Scientific computing is a large part of my education here at Stout and I enjoy trying to simulate various systems in my free time

## Microscopy
These are images I've taken with various microscopes at UW Stout.

### Tungsten Filament (SEM)
I knew that the filaments in a lightbulb were coils but until I saw it in an SEM I had no idea it was a coil of coils. <br />

### Wood Fiber (SEM)
I really love this image but I'm not a biologist so I have no idea what I'm looking at.<br />

### Mushroom Gill (SEM)
This is the higest magnification picture I've taken with the SEM and once again I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking at but I think it might be the spores of the mushroom.<br />

### Copper Wire (Optical)
This was a small piece of copper wire I found in the lab at 400x magnification, where you can see the slight gouges from the wire-drawing process that made it.<br />

### Leaf (Optical)
Here's another example of my limited knowledge of biology, but here is a leaf at 400x magnification. I don't know what kind of leaf it is but I do know we are looking at the plant cells.<br />
