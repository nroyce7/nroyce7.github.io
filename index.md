# Projects

These are some of the projects I am working on or have completed!

## Optical Vortices

I worked on a proof of concept system that uses the optical phenomenon known as an Optical Vortex created with a spatial light modulator, paired with programmable Arduino Boards to encode and decode the beam in order to transmit data through air. <br />

## Surface Plasmon Resonance
Shining light at the interface of a dielectric and a conductor gives us a strange byproduct known as a plasmon; a discrete packet of plasma that acts like a particle. We studied this phenomena in my Intro to Research Methods class. <br />

## Fiber Characterization
For my final project in my Nanomaterials course I looked at various fibers under a Scanning Electron Microscope in order to characterize them.
