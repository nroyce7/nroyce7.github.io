# Welcome!

Welcome to my personal website, where I showcase my research work and share my passion for mathematics and physics. I am currently studying applied mathematics and physics, with a particular focus on mathematical modeling in the physical and biological sciences. My research interests lie at the intersection of these fields, where I seek to apply mathematical concepts to real-world problems and to understand the behavior of complex systems.

As a budding applied mathematician, I am excited about the potential for mathematical modeling and analysis to provide insights into a wide range of phenomena, from the behavior of physical systems to the dynamics of biological processes. I am particularly interested in developing and analyzing mathematical models in the physical and biological sciences, and in studying the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems.

I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my research interests, publications, and projects. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
