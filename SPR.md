A glass slide was covered in gold using a sputter coater, which atomizes gold using plasma. We needed a 40nm layer for optimal SPR and decided to use the Atomic Force Microscope to try to measure the gold slides we were making. It took a lot of trial and error as well as the help of the Intrumentation Innovator, but we managed to get this image that measures the gold ridge on the glass slide.
